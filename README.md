# Vrinda-Store-Annual-Report-2022
# Hello everyone!

I'm excited to share what I found while looking at Vrinda Store's data using Excel.

Goal: Vrinda Store wants to understand its customers better and boost sales in 2023 by making a sales report for 2022.

Here's what I did and learned:
1. I cleaned and checked the data.
2. Used Excel's tools to work with the data.
3. Made tables that show the data clearly.
4. Made the dashboard look good.
5. Adjusted how the dashboard works.

Here's what I found out:
1. Most buyers are young adults aged 21 to 35, making up about 50% of all sales.
2. The best states for sales are Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, making up about 35% of all sales.
3. More women buy from Vrinda Store than men, about 65%.
4. Most sales happen on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra, about 80%.
5. The most sales happened in April.

What Vrinda Store can do: Target ads and offers to women aged 21 to 35 in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.

Thanks to Rishabh Mishra for the data and help!
